				<h2>Manifesto<br>(A work in progress!)</h2>
				<p>No more deaths. No more danger. No more toxic air. The time is over for compromises that leave the car as the dominate feature of our city scape. Lets not be afraid to demand a city that is radically safe, clean and healthy for everyone, and where:
						<br>
						<br> Business districts are free of motorized vehicles * Fifty percent of each street is dedicated to non­motorized traffic * Bike lanes are wide enough for two riders abreast * Resident parking fees equal the cost of an average bike * All major roadways
						include dedicated bus lanes * Half of all parking lots and parking garages are repurposed as parks and housing * Motorist are fully liable for all accidents involving a cyclist or pedestrian * Residents have the right to convert the road space abutting
						their property to a garden plot, community enrichment project or privy * Motorists are fined for any non­emergency use of a horn * Streets are safe for all ages * Motorized vehicles are limited to average speed of bicycles * A minimum five foot
						separation exists for all motorized traffic * Parking is prohibited within 50 feet of all intersections * All residential streets are posted, no through traffic * Cars are required to post signage indicating their public cost ex.I pollute and use
						oil harvested through the loss of human life
