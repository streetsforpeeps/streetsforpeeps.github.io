      <b>ABOUT</b>
      <br>Founded on the community-based food production model of the Somerville Yogurt Making Coop, SGMC offers hyper-local granola made with ingredients from small local farms, honey from our very own Somerville bees and hand-rolled oats.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>COST</b>
      <br>Members can sign up to receive between one and eight pounds of granola each month. Membership terms are for six months and cost $21 for a one pound share. This works out to $3.50 per pound.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>WORK</b>
      <br>Each month, on a Tuesday evening, two members make granola for the whole group. Start times are flexible and the whole process takes about three hours. The number of times each member makes granola during their term is dependent on the number of
      members in the coop and the number of pounds of
	  granola that member receives. As a start, members
	  who receive up to two pounds of granola will make
	  granola once during their six month term. Members
	  who receive up to four pounds will make granola twice.
      For each additional two pounds, members will add one shift.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>LOCATION</b>
      <br>The co-op uses a shared kitchen in First Church Somerville, just outside of Davis Sq. to make, store and distribute shares. Members are given direct access to the church. Pick up times are Wednesday through Sunday of the same week that the granola
      is made.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>GRANOLA</b>
      <br>Our granola is made with ingredients from local farms with transparent and sustainable farming practices. Below is a list of our ingredients. Note that our recipe does not contain nuts and the kitchen we use is designated nut-free.
